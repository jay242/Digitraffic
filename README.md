# Digitraffic
Playing around with open data from digitraffic.fi.

This repository as of now is only intended as a playground for learning python. Nothing here will probably make much sense currently.

## Goal

To use open data from Digitraffic to employ a weather analytics solution.

## Current Implementation

Weather station data is fetched from DigiTraffic website and stored in SQLite databse. From the database, desired sensor can be chosen and its values analyzed.
