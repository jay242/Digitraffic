# Digitraffic
Playing around with open data from digitraffic.fi.

This repository as of now is only intended as a playground for learning python. Nothing here will probably make much sense currently.

## Goal

To use open data from Digitraffic to employ a weather analytics solution.

## Current Implementation

Weather station data is fetched from DigiTraffic website and stored in SQLite databse. From the database, desired sensor can be chosen and its values analyzed. 

## Classes

### FetchandStore

Fetches data from the digitraffic url, processes it and stores it in an sqlite database.

## Methods

#### getData(..) 

Fetches the raw json data from the link provided, extracts the relevant information and stores it in a string. Currently relevant information include road station id, sensor name, value, unit and measurement time.

**Parameter**: url of the appropriate digitraffic data.

####  storedataindb(..)

Extracts values from string generated by getdata(..) method and stores them in an sqlite database.

**Parameter**: string containing relevant sensor data.

#### fetchdatafromdb

Fetches all the instances of the sensor passed to it as argument and returns them as a string.

**Parameter**: name of the sensor whose values are to be fetched from the database.
